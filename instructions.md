# Instructions:

## Starting the Game
Start the GUI by running the Main.java file. It's the wrapper class for our GUI.
After that, you can select heroes by clicking on them. Your last clicked selection will be stored
and will be confirmed when you click on Confirm.

## Playing

Playing a minion is done by clicking on it from your hand. You can also play spells by first clicking on them
in hand then clicking on the target minion/hero.

Attacking with minions follows the same convention: click on the minion inside your field that you wish
to attack with, then click on the enemy minion you want to hit.

Minion attributes are always displayed on the minion card itself.

### Hero Powers
Hero powers are largely the same. You first click use hero power then click on the target if the
power has a target. Otherwise, simply click on use hero power and the power will be done.
